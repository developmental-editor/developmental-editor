- 👋 Hola, I’m Sean Dennis (@developmental-editor). As you can guess, I am a developmental editor -- an editor who helps writers understand their audience, organize their ideas, develop outlines and content outlines (yes, there is a difference), apply instructional design strategies, and review the content to ensure it meets the needs of the audience. 
- 🦉 This level of editing deals with the big picture, getting the high-level stuff correct. In this role, I help authors by serving as a coach, mentor, beta reader, instructional designer, and sometimes a butt-kicker. Getting you across the finish line and helping you write the best book possible is the ultimate goal.
- 👀 I’m interested in working with programmer-authors who are developing tech that helps empower us to clean up our environmental messes, better understand and preserve nature, live more sustainably, and empower social change for a more just and equitable world.
